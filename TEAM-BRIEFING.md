# Expanso GTM Strategy Briefing
*February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

We've completed a comprehensive market analysis across 20+ competitors and identified Expanso's unique position in the market. This document outlines our recommended GTM strategy.

**The Big Insight:** Expanso sits alone at the intersection of **edge computing + streaming + AI inference**. Most "competitors" are actually complementary platforms—we make them work better.

**Primary Wedge:** Cost reduction for Snowflake/Databricks/Elastic customers. Clear ROI (50%+ savings), large market, no direct competition.

**Key Differentiator:** We're not replacing Snowflake, Kafka, or Airflow—we're making them more cost-effective and intelligent.

## Target Market Priority

### Tier 1: Primary Focus (Now)

| Segment | Persona | Pain Point | Our Value |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Snowflake/Databricks users** | Data Eng Manager, FinOps | "Our bill doubled this year" | 50%+ cost reduction |
| **Elastic/Splunk users** | Platform Engineer, SRE | "Log costs are out of control" | Filter at edge, cut ingest |

### Tier 2: Secondary (Q2)

| Segment | Persona | Pain Point | Our Value |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **IoT/Manufacturing** | IoT Architect | "Can't send all sensor data to cloud" | Edge processing, AI at source |
| **AI/ML Teams** | ML Engineer | "Garbage in, garbage out" | Clean data at source |

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Threats (Monitor Closely)

| Competitor | Threat | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| **Cribl** | High - similar log routing | Broader (not just logs), AI/ML, visual builder |
| **Flink** | Medium - stream processing | Simpler, edge-native, managed |
| **Elastic Beats/Logstash** | Medium - log collection | Visual builder, multi-destination |

### Complementary (Partner/Integrate)

| Platform | Relationship | Opportunity |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Snowflake** | We reduce their costs | "Powered by Expanso" badge |
| **Kafka** | We process before/after | Integration docs |
| **Databricks** | We clean data for them | Joint content |
| **Airflow** | We handle streaming | Complementary positioning |

### Key Finding

**Most of our "competitor" list is actually our customer list.** Snowflake users need us. Kafka users need us. Databricks users need us. We're not replacing—we're enhancing.

---

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Message
> "Cut your data platform costs in half. Filter at the source, not the destination."

### By Audience

| Audience | Message |
|----------|---------|
| **Data Engineers** | "Stop paying Snowflake to store data you'll never query" |
| **FinOps/Cost** | "Reduce cloud data costs 50%+ without changing your stack" |
| **SRE/Platform** | "Control log costs without losing visibility" |
| **Executives** | "Process before you pay. Add AI at the edge." |

### Competitive Counter-Positioning

| When they say... | We say... |
|------------------|-----------|
| "We use Snowflake" | "Great—we make Snowflake 50% cheaper" |
| "We have Kafka" | "We process before Kafka, enrich after" |
| "Airflow handles our pipelines" | "Airflow is batch. We're streaming at the edge." |
| "We're evaluating Cribl" | "Cribl routes logs. We process any data with AI." |

## 90-Day Roadmap

### Month 1: Foundation
- [ ] Finalize messaging (this doc)
- [ ] Build competitor battle cards
- [ ] Create ROI calculator
- [ ] Launch landing pages: "Cut Snowflake Costs" / "Replace Logstash"

### Month 2: Content
- [ ] Publish "Why Your Snowflake Bill Keeps Growing" blog
- [ ] Create Logstash → Expanso migration guide
- [ ] Record 3 demo videos (cost reduction, log filtering, AI inference)
- [ ] Customer case study (even if small)

### Month 3: Launch
- [ ] Outbound campaign to Snowflake heavy users
- [ ] Partner announcement (Snowflake marketplace?)
- [ ] Paid search on cost-related keywords
- [ ] Community presence (r/dataengineering, HN)

## North Star Metric

**Total customer cost savings delivered**

Target: 10x of Expanso revenue

*If a customer pays us $10K/year, they should be saving $100K+ on downstream platforms.*

This creates:
- Clear ROI for customers
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Defensible position (switching = losing savings)

---

## Proof Points Needed

| Proof Point | Status | Priority |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Case study: "Company X reduced Snowflake costs 60%" | ❌ Needed | 🔴 High |
| ROI calculator | ❌ Needed | 🔴 High |
| Logstash migration guide | ❌ Needed | 🟡 Medium |
| Performance benchmark (logs/sec) | ❌ Needed | 🟡 Medium |
| Reference architecture diagrams | ❌ Needed | 🟡 Medium |
| AI inference demo | ❌ Needed | 🟢 Nice-to-have |

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. **Target segment priority:** Are we aligned on Snowflake/Databricks cost pain as #1?

2. **Messaging:** Does "Cut costs in half, filter at source" resonate?

3. **Competitive positioning:** Are we comfortable being "complementary" vs. "replacement"?

4. **Proof points:** Who can we get a case study from? Even 30% savings is compelling.

5. **Timeline:** Can we execute the 90-day plan with current resources?
